# CU Software Development Methods and Tools (CSCI 3308)  Project 

## Team Name: 
TimeLess - Our project is always online for users, users no longer need to remember anything and so their tasks are ‘timeless.’ Also, ‘TimeLess’ can be treated as “less time”. Our project helps users save time to write, remember and recall.

## Members:
- Kenny Ellis
- Zanqing Feng

## Description:
For our group project, we have decided as a whole that we would like to proceed in creating a self prioritizing todo list. We decided to create this project, as we constantly find ourselves... being busy college students… unorganized and forgetful. This product would help us gain access to a place where we can see all of our events, meetings, homework, projects, grocery lists.. etc. in an organized and prioritized list.

Our product, will keep the user organized, while utilizing a very simplistic approach. The user will have very easy access to add events to their already existing column/row like list. We will use fun and visually pleasing check boxes, organized categories, and a status bar that will help motivate the user and give them a sense of accomplishment. Goodbye with complicated todo lists which we end up abandoning and resorting to old fashioned sticky notes. Our product will keep users organized, and more importantly, stress free.

## Vision Statement:
To provide our users with cutting edge tools in organization and planning, fit for the changes of everyday life. 

## Motivation:
The traditional paper notebook is outdated! They are easy to lose and inconvenient to carry and hard to look up in certain cases.  Our to do list will be cross platform and stored in the cloud, meaning wherever you are, your to do list goes with you!  

## Risks:
- How do we send data to server for storage and access (do we want rely on an api e.g. domain.com/addTask?taskname=Do%20Homework?taskDescription=do%20physics%20and%20stuff, do we want to post data to server, do we want the backend to create front end code and for front end to be static, etc.)
- How to store files like jpg, png, etc. in database
- We don’t have much experience with backend

## Risk Mitigation:
- We’ll conduct collaborative research on the best way to develop a simple CRUD app
- We’ll conduct collaborative research on how to store and retrieve files in databases 
- We’ll conduct collaborative research on the easiest and best backend service for our relatively simple service
- Overall we will follow tutorials online and absorb as much information as we can to make informed decisions on our frameworks, code, and design

## Version Control:
Git

## Software Development Methodology
We will use Agile as our development methodology.  We will have many small releases and iterations of our product so we are able to adapt quickly to unexpected roadblocks and can easily pivot.  To do this we will have tasks/milestones each team member needs to complete each week/2week cycle.   

## Collaboration Tool:
- Slack
- Google docs

## Dev Tools:
- I (Joe) set up a basic frameork with Python3 and Flask. If these are installed on your machine, you should be able to run app.py with python3, and then open 0.0.0.0:5000 on a web browser to see the local instance. Let me know if you run into issues.
